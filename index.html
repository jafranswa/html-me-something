                <p>During my undergraduate degree I studied under Thad Duhigg, 
                    He worked primarily in large cast work. I learned a great deal about processes 
                    of fabrication and casting, composition of form, and the 
                    craft behind producing sculpture. This was the begining of my 
                    first real independant research as to what career path I would choose.
                    My early work was primarily large cast and fabricated figurative sculpture.</p>

                <p>As my work developed I became increasingly interested in 
                    how the IT field was changing the ways people interacted.
                    This infuenced my decicion to move away from figurative 
                    work and move towards "new media." </p>

                <p>In my early graduate school works I focused largely on kinetic
                    sculpture as a honed my skills in coding, and physiclal programing.
                    These works were signifigant to my creative practice, but did not
                    still engaged the viewer in a passive manner. I wanted to create 
                    objects that had some form of decision making capability or an interactive
                    component. </p>

                <p>In my late graduate school work I used physical programming
                    control kinetic elements of the work.  I aimed to combine my new
                    skills with digital and analog ics with my mechanical aptitude. In these
                    works each component comprising the sculpture carries out its task 
                    unaware of its counterparts. Through each unit or parts place in a 
                    larger system the significance of the single component is transcended. 
                    The qualities of the whole now exceed the qualities of the parts. In 
                    this way the objects self-serving purposes are what make it significant. 
                    Each part of our own body continues its actions. Combined our parts 
                    define who we are. Like each of these components we are part of a larger 
                    system that remains in balance. We exist as a part of a world, a space, 
                    unaware of our significance or futility. </p>
